This is the README file for xeindex.sty v.0.3.
Read xeindex.pdf for the documentation.

XeIndex, based on XeSearch, automatically 
indexes words or phrases in a XeLaTeX
document.

Both the documentation (xeindex.pdf) and
the file (xeindex.sty) are produced from
xeindex.tex with the CodeDoc class.

To typeset the documentation, run XeLaTeX
on xeindex.tex with the 'produce' option
commented out on line 4.

To create xeindex.sty, run (Xe)LaTeX again,
but uncomment 'produce' on the same line.

Licensing of this package is covered by LPPL.
