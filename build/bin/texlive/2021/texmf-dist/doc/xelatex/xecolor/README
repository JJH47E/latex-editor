The xecolor Package v0.1

xecolor package is a simple package which defines about 140 different colors by XeTeX's font
colour feature that can be used in bidirectional texts without any problem. 

The xecolor package is a replacement for xecolour package.

The following commands are provided:

	*\definergbcolor{colorname}{RRGGBB}

This command is similar to the \definecolor command of color package but has only two arguments.
The second argument is triple pair of hex values to specify the colour in RGB space. As an example you
can say \definergbcolor{blue}{0000FF} to define "blue" color. For more examples, see xecolor.sty

	*\xecolor{colorname}

This command is similar to \color command of color package.

	*\textxecolor{colorname}{text}

This command is similar to \textcolor command of color package.

	*\normalxecolor

This command is similar to \normalcolor of color package.
