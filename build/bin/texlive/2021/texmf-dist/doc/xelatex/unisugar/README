The unisugar package 0.92
=========================

The package requires an TeX-alike system that uses Unicode input
in a native way: current examples are XeTeX and LuaTeX.

This package provides syntactic sugar for LaTeX commands, using selected
Unicode characters: Certain Unicode characters can be used as shorthand for
popular LaTeX commands, e.g., a Unicode bullet can be used instead of a \item,
and a pilcrow can be used instead paragraph.

The intent is to minimize the use of English left-to-right characters in
documents whose main language is written right-to-left, since mixing characters
of different directionality confuses both text editors and human beings.

Using this package, you may find yourself typing a bit less, provided you can
configure your text editor or keyboard driver to generate the handful of Unicode
characters defined by this package. More importantly, the package is useful in
defining macros whose name is composed of right-to-left characters and in
minimizing mixed directionality text in right-to-left documents.
