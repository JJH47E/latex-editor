# attachfile2

Attach files to PDF documents


This package can be used to attach files to a PDF document.
It is a further development of Scott Pakin's package
attachfile for pdfTeX. Apart from bug fixes,
package attachfile2 adds support for dvips,
some new options, gets and writes meta information data about
the attached files.

See the embedfile package for a newer package supporting this feature.


This package comes with a Perl script pdfatfi.pl
that should be installed somewhere in PATH as `pdfatfi',
see also package documentation.
