shortdesc Tables of relative positions of curves and asymptotes or tangents in Arabic documents
longdesc This package facilitates, in most cases, the creation of tables
longdesc of relative positions of a curve and its asymptote, or a curve
longdesc and a tangent in one of its points. It depends on tkz-tab and
longdesc listofitems, as well as amsmath, amsfonts, mathrsfs, and
longdesc amssymb. This package has to be used with polyglossia and
longdesc XeLaTeX to produce documents in Arabic.
