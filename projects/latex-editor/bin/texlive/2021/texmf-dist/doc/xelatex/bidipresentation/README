with modifications to get things working properly in both right to
left and left to right modes.

For the documentation, please see the texpower bundle documentation.
Most of the things that work with texpower bundle should also work with
the bidipresentation class. In addition, a sample presentation (file `sample.tex')
is provided to give an overview of the presenttaions produced with the
bidipresentation class.

If you want to report any bugs or typos and corrections in the documentation,
or ask for any new features, or suggest any improvements, or ask any questions
about the package, then please do not send any direct email to me; I will not
answer any direct email. Instead please use the issue tracker:
  <https://github.com/persian-tex/bidipresentation/issues>
In doing so, please always explain your issue well enough, always include
a minimal working example showing the issue, and always choose the appropriate
label for your query (i.e. if you are reporting any bugs, choose `Bug' label).

Current version release date: 2014/09/26
