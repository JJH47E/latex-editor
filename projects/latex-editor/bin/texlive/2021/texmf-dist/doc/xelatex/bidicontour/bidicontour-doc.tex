 \section{Introduction}
The \xpackage{contour} package allows you to have colored contour text; unfortunately this package does not work together with \xpackage{bidi} package; in addition its \texttt{outline} option does not support xdvipdfmx driver.


The \xpackage{bidicontour} package is a re-implementation of \xpackage{contour} package adding bidi support; it also adds support for xdvipdfmx driver when you use \texttt{outline} option of the package.

\section{Documentation}
All the commands of \xpackage{contour} package are prefixed with \texttt{bidi} in \xpackage{bidicontour} package; for instance instead using \cs{contour} command; you will need to use \cs{bidicontour} command. You must always load \xpackage{bidicontour} package before \xpackage{bidi} package (or any other packages that uses \xpackage{bidi} package internally like \xpackage{xepersian} package).
