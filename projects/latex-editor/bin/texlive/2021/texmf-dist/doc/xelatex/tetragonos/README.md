tetragonos
=======

`tetragonos` is a XeLaTeX package for mapping Chinese characters to their codes in 
the Four-Corner Method. Four-Corner Method is an encoding system for Chinese 
characters, which attaches Chinese characters with four of five digits according 
to their shape, so they can be sorted and indexed.
A macro for this purpose is provided in the package.
This package can only run with `xeCJK` package and XeLaTeX.

The package manual in Chinese provides more details and explanations to the 
implementation.
