Package: xevlna   Version 1.1                                   25 March 2017
=============================================================================

The purpose of the package is to insert nonbreakable spaces (in Czech vlna or
vlnka) after nonsyllabic prepositions and single letter conjuctions directly
while TeXing the document. The macros recognise math and verbatim by TeX
means. Inserting nonbreakable spaces by a preprocessor may never be fully
reliable because user defined macros and environments cannot be recognised.
It can be used by both XeLaTeX and plain XeTeX.


Installation:

1. put xevlna.sty to the directory where both xetex and xelatex expect
   included files, preferably texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/xevlna/

2. put xevlna.pdf to a directory where texdoc looks for documentation,
   preferably texmf-dist/doc/xevlna


Changes:

Version 1.1 reflects the increased number of character classes and is backward
compatible with the previous versions of XeTeX.
