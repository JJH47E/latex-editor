Psviewer is a simple script which converts its argument to a
temporary pdf and displays it in the default pdf viewer.

Double-clicking an .eps- or .ps file should result in viewing the
converted file. If this does not work, then try right-click and
'Open with', which should give you the option to set psviewer as
default program for .[e]ps files.
