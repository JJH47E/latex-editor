Hi there,

This directory contains a Type 1 version of the Metafont sources from
the directory above (the mflogo font). The pfb files are intended to
be used with the original TFM files, _don't_ run finst or afmtotfm on
the afm files!

The afm files are provided just in case you want to
install the files on your windowing system. I'm sorry for
the Macintosh users amongst you, but I don't know how to 
create the MacType1 files.

This is version 1.002 of the converted logo font. The only difference 
with the previous version is the change to uppercase names, making it
really simple to use this font as a drop-in replacement for the Y&Y 
version.

The fonts should give exactly the same output results as 
the .mf originals, up to the point of sillyness. All bugs 
in the metafont sources have been kept (and there might be
new ones).

Files are herewith donated to the public domain, and 
provided as is. Note that I feel that the copyright 
from the metafont sources still applies, my only statement 
here is that I do not impose extra restrictions.

Conversion process:
    .mf   -> metapost (c) Hobby -> .eps
    .eps  -> metafog  (c) Kinch -> .pfb
    .pfb  -> hinted & touched up with FontLab v3.0c

I can be reached for propositions/bugs at: taco.hoekwater@wkap.nl

Greetings,

Taco Hoekwater
