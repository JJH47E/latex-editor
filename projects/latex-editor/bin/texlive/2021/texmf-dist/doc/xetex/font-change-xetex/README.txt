This is version 2016.1 of the package "font-change-xetex".
The package consists of macros that can be used to typeset XeTeX documents

For any declared font family, various font style, weight, and size variants like
bold, italics, small caps, etc. are available through standard and custom TeX control statements.
Using the optional argument of the macros, the available XeTeX font features and OpenType tags can be accessed.
