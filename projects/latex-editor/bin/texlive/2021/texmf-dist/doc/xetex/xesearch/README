This is the README file for xesearch.sty v.0.2.
Read xesearch.pdf for the documentation.
t-xeseach.tex is a third party file to use
XeSearch in ConTeXt.

XeSearch is a string finder for XeTeX
(and associated formats).
It searches for words or phrases, possibly
underspecified, and manipulates them, in
essence turning every string into a possible
command.

Both the documentation (xesearch.pdf) and
the files (xesearch.sty and t-xesearch.tex)
are produced from xesearch.tex with the CodeDoc class.

To typeset the documentation, run XeLaTeX
on xesearch.tex with the 'produce' option
commented out on line 8.

To create xesearch.sty and t-xesearch.teX,
run (Xe)LaTeX again, but uncomment 'produce'
on the same line.
