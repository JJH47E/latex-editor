crop
====

This package provides different forms of cropmarks for trimming paper
stacks, for camera alignment and for visualizing the page dimensions. There
are options for centering the page with respect to some physical paper size,
for marking the vertical and horizontal middle axis, for mounting pages on a
physical sheet, for reflecting and inverting the whole document or printing
it upside-down, and for suppressing either text or graphics output.
