   OBSOLETE: do not use in new documents.
   This package will do nothing in LaTeX formats after 2015/01/01
   as the fixes that it implements were incorporated into fixltx2e
   package, which is itself obsolete as since the 2015/01/01 release
   these fixes are in format.

   a) Fix mark handling so \firstmark is taken from the first column
      if that column has marks at all.
      (A copy of Piet van Oostrum's fixmarks package, more or less.)
   b) Keep two column floats like figure* in sequence with single
      column floats like figure.
      (Modelled on  Ed Sznyter's 2.09 package, fixfloats.)
